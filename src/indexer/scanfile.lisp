Some facts about the input file... 

 - Lines are terminated with plain newlines.
 - The encoding is apparently UTF-8.
 - Entries start with a line consisting only of "From ..." 
 - Headers don't seem to be ASCII-clean.
 - Each entry has a "Lines: xxx" header giving the length of the body in lines
 - Email addresses cannot be trusted to be well-formed. We don't need those anyway.
 - Message-IDs seem to be mostly clean (syntax-wise) but contain duplicates. As 
   far as I can tell, these duplicates are legitimate (i.e., the messages are 
   duplicates, not only their IDs)
 - Reference lists seem syntactially broken from time to time. It's somewhat
   horrible what you can find there.

;;; We read the file as binary file. The only reason is, that we want
;;; to know the proper byte offsets of each message in the file, and 
;;; opening in character mode may get file-position to report "arbitrary"
;;; values instead of byte offsets.
;;;
;;; This is uncritical, since we already know the file to be valid
;;; UTF-8, and we read the file one line at a time (with #x0A as line
;;; terminator). No valid UTF-8 sequence can ever cross line boundaries.
